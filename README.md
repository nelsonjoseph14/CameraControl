# CameraControl

This is a Python script that uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling a camera. 
In summary, this script creates a simple GUI with two buttons to control the camera. The "Camera On" button starts the camera, and the "Camera Off" button stops the camera and closes the application. The camera functionality is implemented using the VideoStream class from imutils.video and OpenCV. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library.
